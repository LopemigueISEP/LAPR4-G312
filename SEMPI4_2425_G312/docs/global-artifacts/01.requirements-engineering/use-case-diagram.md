# Use Case Diagram (UCD)

**In the scope of this project, there is a direct relationship of _1 to 1_ between Use Cases (UC) and User Stories (US).**

[//]: # ( However, be aware, this is a pedagogical simplification. On further projects and course units there may also exist _1 to N **and/or** N to 1_ relationships between UC and US.)

[//]: # (**For each UC/US, it must be provided evidences of applying main activities of the software development process &#40;requirements, analysis, design, tests and code&#41;. Gather those evidences on a separate file for each UC/US and set up a link as suggested below.**)
